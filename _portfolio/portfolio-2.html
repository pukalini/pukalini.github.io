This project focuses on predicting air quality levels using machine learning techniques. The system was developed by analysing historical environmental data such as PM2.5 concentrations, temperature, humidity, and other atmospheric factors. Using Python and libraries like Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib, the dataset was cleaned, explored, and visualized to identify key trends. Multiple machine learning models—including Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost—were trained and evaluated to determine the most accurate predictor of air quality.
The final model provides reliable forecasts that can support early warnings and help communities take action to reduce health risks associated with poor air quality.
